"""
The Client is slave: 
- it sends only the player inputs to the server.
- every frame, it displays the server's last received data
Pros: the server is the only component with game logic, 
so all clients see the same game at the same time (consistency, no rollbacks).
Cons: lag between player input and screen display (one round-trip).
But the client can smooth the lag by interpolating the position of the boxes.
